* Description: This program processes numbers, corresponding to student records read in       *
*              from a file, and writes the required results to an output file.                *
*                                                                                             *
*              The student records consist of Student ID numbers, GPA's, class standing       *
*              (freshman-senior) corresponding to values (1-4), and student's age. This       *
*              program specifically computes the mean values for the student's GPA, class     *
*              standing and age, and writes those values to the output file. This program     *
*              also computes the minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of the GPA's,       *
*              and writes those values to the output file as well.                            *
