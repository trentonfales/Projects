Description: This program runs a program that simulates the game "Pass the Pigs" in which
a player tosses two toy pigs that can land in a number of different positions. Depending on
which position the pigs lands in determines the number of points the player will get for that
turn. The winning score is determined by input from the user and the game ends once a player
exceeds the winning score.
